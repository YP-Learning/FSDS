### 1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? e.g.: - values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.

| Elements | Value/Expression |
| :---: | :---: |
| * | Expression/Mathematical operator | 
| 'hello' | Value |
| -87.8 | Value |
| - | Expression/Mathematical operator |
| / | Expression/Mathematical operator |
| + | Expression/Mathematical operator |
| 6 | Value |

### 2. What is the difference between String and a variable?
String is a data type, while variable is a container in which we can store objects/values.
‘hello’ for example is a string, and val = 7, here val is a variable.

### 3. Describe three different data types.

`int`, `float`, `bool`, `complex`, `str`, `list`, `dict` etc. are different datatypes in python, lets explore some of them
#### int
used to store Integer values (numbers without decimal element), we can perform operations like addition, subtraction, multilication, division, mod etc.
```py
a = 7
b = 8

print(a + b) # 15
print(b - a) # 1
print(a * b) # 56
```
